## The programming language

**Swift is a high-level general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. and the open-source community. First released in 2014, Swift was developed as a replacement for Apple's earlier programming language Objective-C, as Objective-C had been largely unchanged since the early 1980s and lacked modern language features.**

- Designed by:	Chris Lattner, Doug Gregor, John McCall, Ted Kremenek, Joe Groff, and Apple Inc.
- First appeared: June 2, 2014

```swift
// Hello World in Swift

print("Hello, World!") 
```

## Language paradigm
`protocol-oriented` `object-oriented` `functional` `imperative` `block structured` `declarative` `concurrent`
