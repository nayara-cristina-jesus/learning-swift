**Swift is a high-level general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. and the open-source community. First released in 2014, Swift was developed as a replacement for Apple's earlier programming language Objective-C, as Objective-C had been largely unchanged since the early 1980s and lacked modern language features.**

- Paradigm: `protocol-oriented`, `object-oriented` `functional` `imperative` `block structured` `declarative` `concurrent`
- Designed by:	Chris Lattner, Doug Gregor, John McCall, Ted Kremenek, Joe Groff, and Apple Inc.
- First appeared: June 2, 2014
